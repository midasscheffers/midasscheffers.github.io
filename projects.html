            <h1>Neural Net</h1>
            <p>
                I have recently started working on a neural network for my self. This is for me to learn how neural networks work. It is still very basic and can't learn but if you have the right data you could (with a little refactoring of the code, because at this point it can only create a random neural net, I have chosen this because I want the net to learn) have it working. Keep in mind that I will expand this project over time and that it might take me a lot of it to develop this into something useful. Anyway 
                <a href="https://github.com/midasscheffers/neural-net/tree/V0.0.1/python/my%20neral%20network">here</a> 
                 is the source code. It is written in python. you can get python 
                <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a>
                 and you don't need any libraries.

            <h1>Japan</h1>
            <p>

              Well, I went to Japan and it was amazing. I went there for a robot competition because I won another prize earlier in the year. The trip to Japan was great although I didn't like the food in the airplane. When we arrived in Tokyo we went to the house. The next day we went exploring the neighborhood. The next 3 days we went to the workshop to learn how to program pepper (A humanoid robot). Then the time came we had to show our skills on stage for the jury. We didn't end up in a good spot though. At least not in the top three. The last two days we went to the biggest arcade in the world and to a cool mauntain. That was my time in Tokyo.

            <h1>Hue</h1>
            <p>
              The last project I did in the first grade was a project which was based on the Philips Hue lamps. To kick off the project we went to a small office of Q42. There We Talked about what we were going to do with the project. I and my team decided to make a lamp where you as a user could put color presets on it and create your own optimal ambiance.
