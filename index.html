        <p>
          Hello, I'm Midas and I am 13 years old. I like programming in general. but there are a few things I love the most. I like game development with pygame and unity.  I like to make a website. I like electronics.
        </p>
        <p>
          enough about my programming life (If you have any unanswered questions about me go to the contact page and contact me.)
          I am a social person who loves company and working together and sharing my thoughts and ideas. I think I can help too if someone gets stuck.
          My favorite animals are cheetahs.
          I love my cat Wolfje (because cats "are" better than dogs)
          Purple is a nice color.
          And spaghetti is delicious.
